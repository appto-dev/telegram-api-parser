You can use bold, italic, underlined, strikethrough, and spoiler text, as well as inline links and pre-formatted code in your bots' messages. Telegram clients will render them accordingly. You can specify text entities directly, or use markdown-style or HTML-style formatting.\nNote that Telegram clients will display an alert to the user before opening an inline link ('Open this link?' together with the full URL).\nMessage entities can be nested, providing following restrictions are met:- If two entities have common characters, then one of them is fully contained inside another.- bold, italic, underline, strikethrough, and spoiler entities can contain and can be part of any other entities, except pre and code.- All other entities can't contain each other.\nLinks tg:\/\/user?id=<user_id> can be used to mention a user by their ID without using a username. Please note:\n\nThese links will work only if they are used inside an inline link or in an inline keyboard button. For example, they will not work, when used in a message text.\nUnless the user is a member of the chat where they were mentioned, these mentions are only guaranteed to work if the user has contacted the bot in private in the past or has sent a callback query to the bot via an inline button and doesn't have Forwarded Messages privacy enabled for the bot.\n\nMarkdownV2 style\nTo use this mode, pass MarkdownV2 in the parse_mode field. Use the following syntax in your message:\n*bold \\*text*\n_italic \\*text_\n__underline__\n~strikethrough~\n||spoiler||\n*bold _italic bold ~italic bold strikethrough ||italic bold strikethrough spoiler||~ __underline italic bold___ bold*\n[inline URL](http:\/\/www.example.com\/)\n[inline mention of a user](tg:\/\/user?id=123456789)\n![](tg:\/\/emoji?id=5368324170671202286)\n`inline fixed-width code`\n```\npre-formatted fixed-width code block\n```\n```python\npre-formatted fixed-width code block written in the Python programming language\n```\nPlease note:\n\nAny character with code between 1 and 126 inclusively can be escaped anywhere with a preceding '\\' character, in which case it is treated as an ordinary character and not a part of the markup. This implies that '\\' character usually must be escaped with a preceding '\\' character.\nInside pre and code entities, all '`' and '\\' characters must be escaped with a preceding '\\' character.\nInside the (...) part of the inline link and custom emoji definition, all ')' and '\\' must be escaped with a preceding '\\' character.\nIn all other places characters '_', '*', '[', ']', '(', ')', '~', '`', '>', '#', '+', '-', '=', '|', '{', '}', '.', '!' must be escaped with the preceding character '\\'.\nIn case of ambiguity between italic and underline entities __ is always greadily treated from left to right as beginning or end of underline entity, so instead of ___italic underline___ use ___italic underline_\\r__, where \\r is a character with code 13, which will be ignored.\nA valid emoji must be provided as an alternative value for the custom emoji. The emoji will be shown instead of the custom emoji in places where a custom emoji cannot be displayed (e.g., system notifications) or if the message is forwarded by a non-premium user. It is recommended to use the emoji from the emoji field of the custom emoji sticker.\nCustom emoji entities can only be used by bots that purchased additional usernames on Fragment.\n\nHTML style\nTo use this mode, pass HTML in the parse_mode field. The following tags are currently supported:\n<b>bold<\/b>, <strong>bold<\/strong>\n<i>italic<\/i>, <em>italic<\/em>\n<u>underline<\/u>, <ins>underline<\/ins>\n<s>strikethrough<\/s>, <strike>strikethrough<\/strike>, <del>strikethrough<\/del>\n<span class=\"tg-spoiler\">spoiler<\/span>, <tg-spoiler>spoiler<\/tg-spoiler>\n<b>bold <i>italic bold <s>italic bold strikethrough <span class=\"tg-spoiler\">italic bold strikethrough spoiler<\/span><\/s> <u>underline italic bold<\/u><\/i> bold<\/b>\n<a href=\"http:\/\/www.example.com\/\">inline URL<\/a>\n<a href=\"tg:\/\/user?id=123456789\">inline mention of a user<\/a>\n<tg-emoji emoji-id=\"5368324170671202286\"><\/tg-emoji>\n<code>inline fixed-width code<\/code>\n<pre>pre-formatted fixed-width code block<\/pre>\n<pre><code class=\"language-python\">pre-formatted fixed-width code block written in the Python programming language<\/code><\/pre>\nPlease note:\n\nOnly the tags mentioned above are currently supported.\nAll <, > and & symbols that are not a part of a tag or an HTML entity must be replaced with the corresponding HTML entities (< with &lt;, > with &gt; and & with &amp;).\nAll numerical HTML entities are supported.\nThe API currently supports only the following named HTML entities: &lt;, &gt;, &amp; and &quot;.\nUse nested pre and code tags, to define programming language for pre entity.\nProgramming language can't be specified for standalone code tags.\nA valid emoji must be used as the content of the tg-emoji tag. The emoji will be shown instead of the custom emoji in places where a custom emoji cannot be displayed (e.g., system notifications) or if the message is forwarded by a non-premium user. It is recommended to use the emoji from the emoji field of the custom emoji sticker.\nCustom emoji entities can only be used by bots that purchased additional usernames on Fragment.\n\nMarkdown style\nThis is a legacy mode, retained for backward compatibility. To use this mode, pass Markdown in the parse_mode field. Use the following syntax in your message:\n*bold text*\n_italic text_\n[inline URL](http:\/\/www.example.com\/)\n[inline mention of a user](tg:\/\/user?id=123456789)\n`inline fixed-width code`\n```\npre-formatted fixed-width code block\n```\n```python\npre-formatted fixed-width code block written in the Python programming language\n```\nPlease note:\n\nEntities must not be nested, use parse mode MarkdownV2 instead.\nThere is no way to specify underline and strikethrough entities, use parse mode MarkdownV2 instead.\nTo escape characters '_', '*', '`', '[' outside of an entity, prepend the characters '\\' before them.\nEscaping inside entities is not allowed, so entity must be closed first and reopened again: use _snake_\\__case_ for italic snake_case and *2*\\**2=4* for bold 2*2=4.","data":[]},{"name":"forwardMessage","description":"Use this method to forward messages of any kind.
